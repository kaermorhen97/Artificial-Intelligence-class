# Problem of Magic square

In the circle of A to J, fill in number from 1 to 10 randomly such that the value in the triangles are equal to the summations of the values filled in the circles surrounding the triangles, for example **A + D + E = 18** and so on.

## Question A
Use **Breadth First Search** and **Depth First Search** to find out possible solutions.

## Question B
Using the solution found, invent a heuristic function **`f(e.g. node level + f(n))`** to find the route to the solution.

## Question C
For these three methods also count the nodes expanded for finding the solution.
